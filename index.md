# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

how sucks my life is and I am still make every day of my life count. 

Maybe not whole day, but even tiny little fraction of the hours suffice me to be myself 

is what support me and energize me.

Just as what Nietzsche said, 

`To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.`
