# My life sucks and I'm gonna love it

## and so do you!ðŸ˜Ž

2019,8,12, marked the day that I finally realized I'm gonna be alone forever 

if I keep burying myself with the pile of excuse that I create for every single complacent monent.

I hate myself in that place. And I know I am the only one who take charge of my own life.

And I know there's no 'it'll be better tomorrow'.

There's only be better today and be awesome tomorrow.

Let's do and rock on!
